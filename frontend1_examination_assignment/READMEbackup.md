## How it works

    Use this commands in the terminal of your VisualStudioCode to load all background nodes needed to run program:

    ---> npm install <---

    After its loaded use this command in your terminal to start program:

    ---> npm run server <---

![alt text](/media/graphic/npm_run_server.jpg)

    This starts a server for the program to be visualized locally on your computer, if it not starts browser automatically:

    Press ctrl and click the link <http://localhost:3000>

    This starts up in your browser:

    Choose sorting in the dropdown menu and click "Sort" and you will get att sorted table of the content that is from an interview from X amount of people.

    If you want to add more interviews to the table, just add more .json files to the "data/dev/users" folder, it doesn't matter what order the properties in the .json file comes in, just be sure that it has at least the right property with the correct value, eg. firstname : "Elvis", lastname : "Presley".

## Conclusion

I think this "app/program" could be used by many different kind of search sites where you want to compare products or things against one and another for example, prisjakt where you maybe want to sort a list of items by price or if you are searching for a specific trait.

Comments are added in both the (javascript) script.js and (HTML) index.html files if other developers need guidance to handle or care for the code, folder to this files are: "www/dev".

This was a very fun and challenging assignment where i really had to use all the skills we have learned over the past few week, coupled with a serious amount of time googling things that were unclear, and i think it turned out pretty good.
